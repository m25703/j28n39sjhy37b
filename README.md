# Project Name

This readme file will guide you through the installation process and getting this application up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have SQL installed and configured on your computer. You should have a working SQL server that you can connect to and run SQL queries.

## Installation

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Change to the server directory:

```bash
cd server
```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open another terminal window and change to the client directory:

```bash
cd ../client
```

6. Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

7. Start the client application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, the application will be up and running on `localhost:3000`. You can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

- **SQL Connection Issues**: If you encounter any issues connecting to your SQL server, ensure that the server is running and that you have provided the correct credentials in the server configuration file. Change the database name as required.

- **Port Conflict**: If port `3000` is already in use on your machine, you can specify a different port by modifying the client's configuration file. Open the `client/package.json` file and update the `"start"` script to include the desired port number.
